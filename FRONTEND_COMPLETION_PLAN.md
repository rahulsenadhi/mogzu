# Mogzu Frontend Completion Plan

> **Author**: Claude (planning pass, no code written)
> **Date**: 2026-05-21
> **Inputs read**: PRDs v2–v5, Add-On PRD, all 6 sprint plans, user stories, memory.md, routes.tsx (1465 lines), full component directory listing (226 files), last 30 commits
> **Status method**: Inferred from routes + memory work log + commit history. Status flags marked `(verify)` need a 60-second open-in-browser check before final classification. This is honest scaffolding — not a guess pretending to be ground truth.

## SECTION 1 — PLATFORM SUMMARY

**What Mogzu does (3 sentences):**
Mogzu is a B2B corporate-experience marketplace covering three modules — Events, Gifting, and SpaceX (DSpace/Coworking/Stay) — built on React + Supabase + Tailwind. Corporate buyers (L1 employees, L2 managers, L3 admins/HR) discover and book against budgets and approval workflows while vendors fulfil and Mogzu admins moderate. Phase 3+ adds a public marketplace, SSO/SOC2 enterprise readiness, native mobile shell, multi-currency settlement, and an autonomous AI booking agent.

**All 6 (actually 8) user roles + primary jobs:**

| Role | Primary job |
|---|---|
| L1 Employee | Discover, book, send gifts, track own spend |
| L2 Manager | Approve team booking requests, personalise celebrations |
| L3 Admin / HR | Set budgets, manage employees, top-up wallet, run reports, configure gifting programme + travel policy |
| Vendor | List products/spaces/events, manage calendar + orders, accept payouts |
| Mogzu Admin | Approve vendors + products + promotions, set commissions, manage clients, handle disputes |
| Account Manager (internal) | Manage assigned client portfolio, build shortlists |
| Partner (external) | Refer clients, resell services, list own products, white-label catalogues |
| Support agent | Resolve corporate + vendor tickets |

**Current sprint phase:**
Per recent commits (`bca5c76`, `f57422e`, `f4877e7`, `9e77906`), runtime stubs for P4 + P5 features have landed alongside completed Phase 1 P0/P1/P2 work and Phase 3. Effective state: **Phase 1+2+3 substantially shipped (with known glitches); Phase 4/5 in mixed runtime-stub state; final polish + verification + gap-fill is the remaining frontend work.**

## SECTION 5 — RECOMMENDED BUILD ORDER

Batches sized 5–8 screens. P0/P1 first, then high-impact P2/Add-On gaps, then P3/P4/P5 polish.

### BATCH 1 — Booker-side communication parity (P1 gaps, quick wins) ✅ 2026-05-21
- ✅ Inject `BookingMessagesPanel` into `/bookings/:id` (booker side) — glitch #3
- ✅ Add "Raise a dispute" button + modal on `/bookings/:id` — missing #5
- ✅ Fire manager-approval notification on `SpaceBookingPage` submit — glitch #5
- ✅ Fire manager-approval notification on `GiftingSendPage` submit — glitch #5
- ✅ Fire vendor-cancel notification on `CancelBookingPage` booker path — glitch #6
- ⚪ Unread message badge in `NotificationBell` — already shipped pre-Batch
- ⏸️ Email digest of unread messages — deferred to Batch 10 (needs schema extension)

**Goal:** Booker side reaches communication parity with vendor side. Closes 4 of the highest-impact open P1 gaps.
**Estimated sessions:** 2 (used 1)

### BATCH 2 — Listing trust + save signals (P2 gaps, catalogue-wide) ✅ 2026-05-21
- ✅ Reusable `ListingReviewsPanel` component (reads from `reviews`)
- ✅ Mount `ListingReviewsPanel` on event detail page
- ✅ Mount on space detail page
- ⏸️ Mount on gifting product detail page — no per-product detail route exists; defer until ProductBookingPage scope decided
- ⏸️ Sprinkle `WishlistHeart` button on listing cards (events / gifting / dspace / compare) — Batch 2b carry-over
- ✅ `RatingBadge` aggregate component built; mount on listing cards = Batch 2b carry-over

**Goal:** Reviews and wishlist heart go from "exists at module level" to "visible everywhere a listing renders." Foundation for P5.3 ratings flywheel.
**Estimated sessions:** 2 (used 2)

**Batch 2b done 2026-05-21:** UUID-guarded `WishlistHeart` + `RatingBadge`; mounted on `ExplorePage` cards; `SpaceXPage` heart swapped to canonical `WishlistHeart` + orphaned state removed.

**Batch 2c carry-over:** StaySearchPage + CorporatePicksPage sprinkle; remaining 18 local-state heart files swept as their module gets real-data wiring; gifting product detail mount.

### BATCH 3 — Vendor calendar + settings (P0 gaps)
- Drag-to-block grid on `VendorCalendarPage`
- Recurring availability rule editor (e.g. "Mon–Fri 9–6, closed Sun")
- Buffer time field on listings (5.3 acceptance)
- Notify booker on availability-change-after-confirm
- Replace `/vendor/settings` placeholder with real profile/payout/notification settings
- Vendor performance: restore dropped drawer stats + add PDF export

**Goal:** Vendor operational accuracy + profile completeness. Removes blocker for "vendor can fully self-serve."
**Estimated sessions:** 3

### BATCH 4 — Vendor onboarding end-to-end (P0 gap + P5.2 enabler)
- Wire `vendorOnboardingApi.ts` to Supabase (Story 1.3)
- Module selection persistence (Story 1.3 acceptance)
- GST optional-on-signup / required-before-first-booking gate
- Mogzu Admin vendor approval queue (`/admin/vendor-applications`) real-data wiring (Story 1.4)
- Rejection-reason checklist + structured feedback email payload
- Resubmit flow for rejected vendors
- KYC step (Persona/Onfido) — minimal viable: file upload, status field, admin review (P5.2 part 1)

**Goal:** Vendor goes from "form submits to nowhere" to "verified vendor in dashboard." Critical path for any new supply.
**Estimated sessions:** 4

### BATCH 5 — Corporate user-management + auth gaps (P0 gaps)
- Domain validation on `/signup/corporate` (Story 1.1)
- Bulk invite CSV upload on `/user-management` (Story 1.2)
- Pending/accepted/expired invite status table
- Invite resend + 72h expiry enforcement
- `MyProfilePage` real-data wiring
- `CompanySettingsPage` real-data wiring
- Approval workflow editor on `/settings/workflow`

**Goal:** Corporate L3 admin can self-onboard a real team. Removes "contact our team to add users" friction.
**Estimated sessions:** 3

### BATCH 6 — Booking trust pipeline (Add-On F2 + F3 — high business value)
- `BookingTrackerPage` real-data status pipeline (Events variant)
- Same for Gifting variant
- Same for DSpace variant
- OTP entry + photo upload + GPS capture component
- Field-agent app shell on `/agent/dashboard`
- Proof-of-conditions PDF rendered on `/bookings/:id`

**Goal:** Eliminates disputes; gives buyers tamper-proof execution evidence. Demanded by enterprise corporates.
**Estimated sessions:** 4

### BATCH 7 — Razorpay + Wallet hardening (P0 critical gap)
- Razorpay Checkout SDK on `BookingPaymentPage` (replace operator-paste UTR)
- Razorpay webhook handler (Supabase Edge Function)
- Wallet top-up webhook-verified (replace client-side balance bump)
- Atomic wallet debit RPC (replace read-modify-write)
- Razorpay refund API call on cancel-within-policy

- `/browse/mogzu-direct/...` real-data + parity with vendor listings
- `/admin/categories` enable/disable + reorder (Add-On F5)
- Admin disable cascades to corporate-facing catalogue within 60s
- Mogzu Direct listing detail polish
- Category management against active-listings confirmation modal

**Goal:** Admin self-serve catalogue control. Reduces ops load. Add-On Feature 5 closes.
**Estimated sessions:** 2

### BATCH 9 — Sub-users + RBAC (Add-On F6)
- `/admin/team` invite flow with role picker

**Estimated sessions:** 3

### BATCH 10 — Phase 3 inbound funnel + i18n polish

- AI Sales Agent pipeline at `/sales/pipeline`
- Sitemap.xml + JSON-LD on listing pages (verify)
- `useCurrency` hook applied to every price display surface

**Estimated sessions:** 2

### BATCH 11 — Enterprise revenue completion (P3.8 + P4.2)
- Outstanding invoices view at `/account/invoices` (corp)
- Self-serve plan upgrade UI at `/account/billing`
- Stripe + Razorpay reconciliation dashboard
- Dunning email preview (4-retry/14-day banner)
- Auto-downgrade flag display on dashboard

**Goal:** SaaS recurring revenue loop visible end-to-end. Contract corporates see and pay invoices.
**Estimated sessions:** 2

**Goal:** Final UI surfaces shipped. P5.4 complete. Mock pages contained.
**Estimated sessions:** 2

### BATCH 15 — Data quality + glitch sweep ✅ (2026-05-24)
- Combo `occasion` metadata populated on all 6 combo mocks in `apparelProducts.ts`

- Build clean; plan complete across all 15 batches

**Goal:** Backlog from memory.md closed. Doc reconciled with reality.
**Estimated sessions:** 2

### POST-PLAN BATCHES 23–37 — Supabase wiring sweep ✅ (2026-05-24)

Continuation after the 15-batch plan. All Section 2 route rows are ✅ except infra-blocked payment/voice crons.

| Batch | Focus |
|---|---|
| 23–24 | SpaceX/coworking + events catalogue Supabase |
| 25–27 | Event detail, vendor event-activity, admin events/DSpace |
| 28–29 | Classic booking TDZ fixes, ActivitySuite metrics |
| 30–31 | Celebration + booking confirmation chains |
| 32 | Marketing CMS + admin settings hub |
| 33 | Deals, promotions catalog, HeyGenie |
| 34 | Celebration listing IDs, browse/shortlist banners |
| 35 | Product booking → `/booking-flow` live persist |
| 36 | Admin legacy surfaces + AI autonomy + apparel |
| 37 | Legacy `/vendor/promotions` redirect + `db.promotions.setPaymentReference` |
| 38 | Lead operations hub — unified inbox/pipeline/Quick Share; assignment RLS + picker |
| 39–41 | Lead ops enterprise UX + demo parity (`leadDemoPatch`, spam tab, pipeline status in demo) |
| 42 | Vendor calendar polish — booked → booking request, block success notice, no-listings banner, Loader2 fix; Compare wishlist heart |
| 43 | Gifting Shop — `mogzuListingId` on approved partner products; live wishlist + compare + booking enquiry `listingId` |
| 44 | Gifting Shop live `listPublicListings(gifting)` merge |
| 45 | Approval workflow — `evaluateCorporateApproval` on space/event/gifting booking review; settings preview panel |
| 46–51 | Multi-step approval chain, booking create paths, dedicated `required_approval_levels` / `approved_approval_levels` columns |
| 52 | Lead inbox bulk assign — `LeadBulkAssignBar`, checkbox selection, `assignLeadOwner` batch |
| 53 | Sales pipeline kanban drag-and-drop (`LeadPipelineKanban`, react-dnd) |
| 54 | Lead saved views — `leadSavedViews.ts` + `LeadSavedViewsBar` (inbox + pipeline, localStorage) |
| 55 | Approval chain columns-only (`purpose_note` user text); notifications + payment approver picker cleanup |
| 56 | SQL strip legacy approval JSON from `purpose_note`; corporate publish → `broadcastSystem` |
| 57 | L3-only publish tab; broadcast email queue (prefs + high-priority `forceEmail`) |
| 58 | Corporate inbox filters; edge `drain-notification-emails` (Resend queue worker) |
| 59 | Corporate notifications realtime inbox (`subscribeToTable` on `notifications`) |

**Verified:** `npm run build` exit 0 after each batch. **Uncommitted** in workspace until user requests a git commit (batches 23–59).

**Apply in Supabase (recent):** `20260526000001_booking_approval_levels.sql`, `20260527000001_strip_booking_approval_purpose_note.sql`

**Iteration backlog (post-59):** N8N cron schedule for email drain.

**Estimated total: ~37 sessions across 15 batches + 15 post-plan batches.** Each batch is one user-journey slice in one module so context stays loaded.

## BUILDING RULES

1. **Match existing component patterns exactly** — `SharedHeader`, `CorporateRoute`, `db.*` namespace, `storageService`, `realtimeService`. Never bypass.
2. **Use ui-ux-pro-max skill for any new UI decision.** If unsure, match nearest existing screen — do not invent new patterns.
3. **Use andrej-karpathy-skills for code quality.** No premature abstractions, no over-engineering, surface assumptions, define verifiable success criteria per task.
4. **Use superpowers methodology** — plan, build, verify. Run `npm run build` after every file touched. Manual smoke in browser after every batch.
5. **Add DEMO_DATA fallback on every Supabase connection** (per `feedback_demo_data_fallback.md` convention). Empty tables must still render a believable demo surface.
6. **Never delete working code.** Replace by hiding from nav and adding a `// LEGACY` comment if needed, then revisit in Batch 15.
7. **Build clean after every single file.** Never let a broken build accumulate.
8. **Log every change in FIXES.md** at repo root (one-line entry per file touched).
9. **One screen at a time** — never edit two components in the same commit unless they share a literal contract (e.g., shared `<ListingReviewsPanel>` + 1 mount site).
10. **Show user what I'm building before I build it** — paste the proposed diff or component skeleton in chat, await go-ahead.
11. **If unsure about design — match nearest existing screen pattern. Do not invent new patterns.**
12. **Stop after every batch and report.** Report = "what shipped + what verified + what's next + any blockers."

## OPEN VERIFICATION ITEMS — RESOLVED 2026-05-21

Static-analysis sweep (grep + Read on each component, no browser). Results below; Section 2 status flags above updated inline.

| # | Surface | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/dashboard` | ✅ wired | `db.bookings`, `db.employees`, `db.budgets` calls in `Dashboard.tsx` useEffect |
| 2a | `/bookings` | ✅ wired | Batch 3 (`2666caf`): `db.bookings.listByCorporate` / `listByUser` |
| 2b | `/bookings/:id` | ✅ wired | Batch 3b/3c (`b4a0eda`, `d0f8f7d`): hybrid overlay + realtime UPDATE |
| 3 | `/admin` (index) | ✅ wired | `loadAdminStats()` aggregates bookings, payouts, support tickets, invoice runs, audit events; demo slices when empty |
| 4 | `/admin/vendor-applications` | ✅ wired | `listApplications` + `setStatus` + `setKycStatus` from `vendorOnboarding` |
| 5a | `/user-management` | ✅ wired | `db.userProfiles.listByCorporate` + invites + deactivate + department upsert; demo fallback when corp has no rows |
| 5b | `/invite/:token` | ✅ wired | `db.userInvites.getByToken` + `getPostLoginPath` after accept |
| 6a | `/my-profile` | ✅ wired | Auth profile load/save, notification prefs, password change, subscription + invoice runs on billing tab |
| 6b | `/company-settings` | ✅ wired | Stats from Supabase (users, wallet, approval rules) |
| 6c | `/billing-invoices` | ✅ wired | `BillingInvoicesPage` + `listCorporateInvoices` |
| 7a | `/explore` | ✅ wired | `listPublicListings` + `storageService` |
| 7b | `/p/:slug` | ✅ wired | `getLiveBlockBySlug` + JSON-LD emit |
| 7c | `/blog` | ✅ wired | `supabase.from('cms_blocks_live').select()` |
| 8a | `/admin/subscriptions` | ✅ wired | `listPlans` + `listSubscriptions` + `corporateAccounts.list` |
| 8b | `/admin/api-keys` | ✅ wired | `listApiKeys` + CRUD ops |
| 8c | `/admin/webhooks` | ✅ wired | `listEndpoints` + CRUD ops |
| 8d | `/admin/white-label` | ✅ wired | `listPartners` + `upsertPartner` |
| 8e | `/admin/access-reviews` | ✅ wired | `listReviews` + `createReview` + `snapshotReview` |
| 9 | `/agent/dashboard` | ✅ wired | `db.bookingTracker.listFieldAgentQueue` + enriched events |

**Result: all P0/P1 operational surfaces wired ✅ with demo fallbacks where Supabase tables are empty (Section 2 complete as of post-plan Batch 37).** Remaining work is infra-blocked (Razorpay webhooks, N8N crons, VAPI voice) or Section 3/4 backlog enhancements — not un-wired screens.

Each verification result updates Section 2 in-place; this is intentionally a living doc.
